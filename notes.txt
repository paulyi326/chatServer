moved db call back into api module. uncaught errors were showing up as
CORS error on client side for some reason

next:
- handle for edge cases like when server goes down
- for some reason, there are two users in a room sometimes. it's the same user but a different session, so somehow, a user is connecting twice without disconnecting in between
- add names to user objects in mongoLab
- download async.js
